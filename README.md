PP1.py
This program cleans and analyzes e-commerce product data by handling dates, correcting negative values, and removing duplicates. It generates insights like overall and category-wise return rates, monthly return trends, and identifies top returned products. Visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn, forming a detailed return analysis dashboard.

PP2.py
This script trains a logistic regression model to predict product return probability based on features like quantity, revenue, and category. It evaluates model performance and assigns return risk levels to each product. The output includes two CSVs: one with all predictions and another with high-risk products (probability > 0.8)
